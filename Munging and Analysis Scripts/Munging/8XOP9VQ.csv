842CN6,Okay so where's the thing we're suppose to be doing??,1363017632176,QUESTION
TUT,"The white-fur phenotype is probably recessive - so only ""gg"" genotype cats can have white fur.",1363017652954,
TUT,"To have only orange chil892CS3n, each cross between the parents has to include a dominant ""G"" allele.",1363017652955,
